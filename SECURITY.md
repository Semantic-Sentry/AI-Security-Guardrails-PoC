# Robust Security Framework (v2.0)

## Optimization Model
We utilize Constrained Optimization for risk assessment:
- Objective: Minimize Beta Risk
- Constraint: Alpha (Utility) >= Min_Threshold

## Defense Strategy
Transitioning from lexical pattern matching to Semantic Embeddings for higher robustness.
